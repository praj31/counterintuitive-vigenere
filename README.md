# Counterintuitive Vigenere Cipher

The objective of this application is encrypt and decrypt a string using the Vigenere Cipher. However, there is a little twist.

Normally, Vigenere Cipher uses the domain of alphabet. In this version I have incorporated digits as well and thereby extending the domain of 26 to that of 36. 

This increases the complexity of the encryption and makes it difficult to crack and hence ensuring extra safety. 

An attempt has been made to explain you the algorithm and the steps so that even a person with no background of the cryptography world can make sense out of it.
